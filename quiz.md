1. What is method that can be applied using SOM?
   - [ ] Just Unsupervised learning
   - [ ] Just Supervised learning
   - [ ] Unsupervised and supervised learning

2. If we want to set the size of grid on SOM, which is the function below is appropriate?
   - [ ] `som()`
   - [ ] `somgrid()`
   - [ ] `plot.kohonen()`
   
3. Say, we want to make cluster using SOM, and we have a huge of data that has a lot of feature, each feature has a different range of data point. Should we do scale standardization?
   - [ ] Yes, we should
   - [ ] No, we shouldn't
   
4. If we want to show node count from the kohonen plot, what `type` does we use that appropriate?
   - [ ] `type = "changes"`
   - [ ] `type = "counts"`
   - [ ] `type = dist.neighbours"`
   - [ ] `type = "codes"`
   
5. Say, we have a dataset that contain factor data. From this choice below, what statement is not true based on SOM?
   - [ ] Do some data pre process to make the factor data to be numeric data
   - [ ] Not use those coloumn that contain factor data
   - [ ] Process those data without pre-process and use SOM
